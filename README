A small example of how to build a shared library on OS X and P/Invoke it from Mono.

I experienced some nasty gotchas whilst making this. Mono kept giving me DllNotFoundException
and I almost kicked something. So I set the environment variable MONO_LOG_LEVEL=debug, and I 
could see that indeed mono was finding the dylib, but was complaining that the architecture 
wrong. So I added the -m32 flag to the compile and link steps and it worked like a charm

Knock yourself out.
